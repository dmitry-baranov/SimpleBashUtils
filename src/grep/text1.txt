The history of computers goes back over 200 years. At first theorized 
by mathematicians and entrepreneurs, during the 19th century mechanical calculating machines were designed and 
built to solve the increasingly complex number-crunching challenges. 
The advancement of technology enabled ever more-complex computers by the early 20th century, 


and computers became larger and more powerful.
